# Decoding the Rhythms of Emotion: A Sentimental Journey through Music Genres
## Text Mining Project

## Project Description
The aim of the project was to use the power of text mining techniques to discover the emotional background of songs through their lyrics, as well as develop a classification model to identify the genre of a song based on key words from the lyrics.

## Project Objective
As mentioned above, the project was divided into two main tasks:
- **Genre Identification**: training machine learning models on a dataset containing song lyrics and their corresponding genres to accurately predict the song genre on unknown data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: explore the emotional undertones of the songs of the dataset, in order to try to identify patterns (for example, predominant sentiments) in specific song genres. This part was more flexible and was guided with open-ended questions.

This project also had a competitive side, since the team had to submit the results of the machine-learning model into a Kaggle competition for posterior evaluation.

## Dataset Details
The dataset used was divided into train (used to build the machine-learning models) and testing sets (goal is to predict the musical genre of the song lyrics and access if the model is performing well). 

- **id**: unique identifier
- **title**: song title
- **artist**: main artist of the song
- **year**: year the song was launched in
- **views**: number of views the song has on an online music service
- **features**: includes names of collaborating artists (will be EMPTY otherwise)
- **lyrics**: lyrics of the song - include tags for specific sections 
- **tag**: main musical  genre of the song
